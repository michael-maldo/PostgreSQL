# ssh-key setup
The correct fix (clean + professional)

Do not try to recover or guess.

## ✅ Generate a brand-new CI key (once)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/github_ci_deploy -C "github-ci-deploy"

## ✅ Add public key to VPS
cat ~/.ssh/github_ci_deploy.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

## ✅ Add private key to GitHub Secrets

Secret name:

SERVER_SSH_KEY


Value = contents of:

~/.ssh/github_ci_deploy

## ✅ Test locally (important)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_ci_deploy deploy@YOUR_VPS


No password prompt = correct.

## 🔐 Lessons (this is senior-level knowledge)

SSH keys are single-source of truth

Re-running ssh-keygen -f destroys identity

CI keys should:

Have unique filenames

Be generated once

Be documented
